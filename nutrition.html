                <p>Your eating habits—what you constantly eat and drink—are the most important factors affecting your
                    health. Health is defined as a state of complete physical, mental, spiritual, and social well-being.
                </p>
                <p>Knowing food items and how they affect your health when making food choices is a big step towards
                    protecting and improving your health.</p>

                <h3>The Nutrients</h3>
                <p>Foods contain groups called "nutrients":</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proteins</li>
                    <li>Fats</li>
                    <li>Carbohydrates</li>
                    <li>Minerals</li>
                    <li>Vitamins</li>
                    <li>Water</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>After getting to know nutrients, the second step is knowing <strong>how much</strong> and
                    <strong>when</strong> to consume them. Eating correctly means creating a sufficient and balanced
                    combination of healthy foods tailored to you.
                </p>

                <p>Transforming these changes into habits is the most important part, because often we fail to change
                    our habits even when we know they are wrong. Whether your diet affects your health positively or
                    negatively depends on how long you apply it. Eating well for just one meal or one day won't bring
                    benefits, just as the opposite won't cause immediate harm.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>How do we reach this mindfulness?</h3>
                <p>The answer starts with knowing ourselves. You need to analyze the factors affecting your diet, your
                    health status, your needs, environmental factors, and your psychology well.</p>
                <p>If you work in a company or are a student, or if you work shifts, you may not have the opportunity to
                    find the food you want at any moment. Besides, if you are a vegetarian, a ketogenic diet will not
                    suit you, just as aiming to consume only vegetables will not suit you in the long run if the cuisine
                    you are used to is meat-heavy.</p>

                <p>Our health status is a very important determinant for our food choices. Metabolic diseases such as
                    diabetes, blood pressure, kidney function problems require special nutrition. Our social and
                    economic status also affects our food choices.</p>

                <p>You have all the rational information about yourself, you know what to eat, but your psychology comes
                    into play when selecting and consuming food. Mindful nutrition requires you to question whether
                    you are meeting your emotional and physical needs while choosing and consuming food. Often, what we
                    eat without thinking or realizing is not correct in terms of amount and variety.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>What is the benefit of mindful nutrition?</h3>
                <p>The habit of mindful nutrition describes knowing and applying <strong>what</strong> to eat,
                    <strong>how much</strong>, <strong>when</strong>, and <strong>why</strong>. Mindful eating should
                    continue until the food on your plate is finished.
                </p>
                <p>If you eat knowing what you are eating and how much you need, you reduce the risk of overeating. If
                    you know every food according to its nutrients and the benefit-harm characteristics it provides us,
                    you will know how your diet will affect your health in the long run.</p>

                <h3>3 Functions of Nutrients in the Body</h3>
                <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.6;">
                    <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Proteins, carbohydrates, and fats are the body's energy sources. We
                        need energy not only for our activities but also for our organs to work, for the absorption of
                        food, and for growing during the growth age. Taking enough energy is important for the
                        continuity of body functions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Proteins and minerals like calcium are the building blocks of the
                        body. Our muscles, bones, and teeth are formed from these.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regulation:</strong> They take part in the synthesis of hormones and enzymes, in the
                        balance of body fluid, and in many metabolic events.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem; text-align: center;">5 Questions for Mindful Eating</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem; color: var(--text-muted);">"What is my intention?" should
                be the first question every time before starting to eat.</p>

            <div class="grid grid-2" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                <div class="card" style="border-left: 4px solid var(--primary);">
                    <h3>1. Intention</h3>
                    <p>Does this food serve my intention? If we are athletes, does it help our performance? If we want
                        to lose weight, does it help us lose fat? If we are children, does it help us grow? Remembering
                        our intention before eating should be our first step in mindful eating.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card" style="border-left: 4px solid var(--secondary);">
                    <h3>2. What?</h3>
                    <p>Do you know the food on your plate? What is its nutritional content? Is your plate
                        carbohydrate-heavy or protein/fat? Is it natural, processed, or packaged? What does the label
                        say?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card" style="border-left: 4px solid var(--accent);">
                    <h3>3. How Much?</h3>
                    <p>Remember that "amount" is what makes nutrition sufficient and balanced. Eating more than you
                        need, even of a very healthy food, will be harmful. Remember that <strong>the dose makes the
                            poison</strong>. Your goal should be to consume a balanced amount from all food groups.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card" style="border-left: 4px solid var(--primary-dark);">
                    <h3>4. When?</h3>
                    <p>Eating at the right time is crucial to use the effects of food on structure/regulation and to
                        spend the energy we get. "Right time" changes based on how you live your day. It is correct to
                        take higher energy when energy needs are high, and lower energy when the body slows down.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="card" style="margin-top: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid salmon;">
                <h3>5. Why?</h3>
                <p>Am I really hungry? Or am I eating to complete my daily nutritional needs, or because of emotions
                    like accompanying someone, forgetting something, or sharing my joy?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card" style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #f0fdf4; border: 1px solid #bbf7d0;">
                <h3 style="color: var(--primary-dark);">Why do we do this?</h3>
                <p>The contribution of correct nutrition to total health is huge. When we know foods correctly, place
                    them correctly in our lives, and are aware of what we eat, our emotions, and our needs at the moment
                    of eating, we will have started a healthy diet that is special to us.</p>
                <p>Then there is one more important step: <strong>to continue and turn it into a habit.</strong></p>
